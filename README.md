# dsh-verifier-mode

P0 pre-research for a DeepSeek Harness plugin. This tree is the scaffold and the eight spikes from the approved design. It is not the verifier MVP.

Spikes run against a local checkout of [deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). They use DSH's mock model adapter and a local HTTP mock. They do not call DeepSeek, TypeSafe, Jev, or any other hosted model, and they do not need an API key.

## Run the spikes

Node must satisfy DSH's engines field (`^22.19` or `>=24`). On a machine whose default Node is older, put a matching Node on `PATH` first.

```bash
# one-time: clone DSH next to this repo, or anywhere, and install it
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness.git
cd deepseek-harness
git checkout 5badb15009ae1756c3afe0ae0cef1faafc290ccc
pnpm install

cd /path/to/dsh-verifier-mode
npm install
DSH_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/deepseek-harness npm test
```

`DSH_ROOT` defaults to `/home/ubuntu/deepseek-harness` in this environment. Each file under `spikes/` is one P0 item. Verdicts, the DSH APIs each spike called, and the design notes are in [docs/P0-REPORT.md](docs/P0-REPORT.md).
